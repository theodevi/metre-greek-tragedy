### The functioning of metre in Classical Greek drama: a distant reading approach

This repository holds the dataset and functions developed as part of the "The functioning of metre in Classical Greek drama: a distant reading approach" dissertation.

The data files are taken directly from the sources indicated in the folder names. No changes have been made to the files - the dataset is being republished to create an open understanding of the exact data used in the work. The JSON files in this folder comprise the character data and the final dataset used for the analysis undertaken in this work.

The "code" folder houses the functions developed to extract metre from lines automatically. This code has been primarily developed for this work, with some ideas being taken from previous endeavours into automatic metre identification. The testing sets in this folder comprise two test sets in JSON format and one in IPYNB format. The data for the sets has been taken from works on Greek metre, such as *The Lyric Metres of Greek Drama* by A. M. Dale and Greek Metre by *M. L. West*. Test sets have been evaluated manually.
